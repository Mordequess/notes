\section{Chapter 1 -- Our Place in the Universe}
\subsection{Overview}
A naive look at the sky, which seems to rotate around us, implies we live in a {\bf geocentric} Universe, ie. that everything orbits around the Earth. We know now that this is untrue, but the path to this knowledge was a long one.

We can refer to our place in the Universe as our {\bf cosmic address}, this is our {\bf solar system}; which consists of the Sun and all objects that orbit it including rocky {\bf asteroids} and icy {\bf comets}. Our solar system, and all the stars we can see, make up a small portion of the {\bf Milky Way} galaxy.

A {\bf galaxy} is an island of stars in space containing anywhere between a few hundred million to trillions of stars. The Milky Way is a relatively large one, with 100 billion stars. We are located about halfway from the center of the Milky Way (the {\bf galactic center}) to the edge of the {\bf galactic disk}.

In summary: the Earth is a planet in the solar system, which is a collection of objects orbiting a star, which is in the milky way galaxy, which is a part of the {\bf local group} of galaxies, which is part of the {\bf local supercluster} of groups, which is somewhere in the {\bf Universe}.

The local group contains about 40 galaxies, and is one of what we call {\bf galactic clusters} -- groups of galaxies with more than a few members. Superclusters are essentially clusters of galactic clusters, as the Universe seems to be arranged ingiant chains and sheets with large divides between them. The local group is on the edge of the local supercluster.

\subsection{The Big Bang and the Expanding Universe}
We have observed that the Universe seems to be \emph{expanding}, that is, the distance between galaxies is increasing. By extrapolating backwards, we imagine that all matter must ahve existed at the same point in the past and exploded outward in a {\bf Big Bang}. Based on the rate of expansion, we believe this happened approximately 14 billion years ago.

Note that though the distance between galaxies is increasing, the distances between objects within galaxies is \emph{not}.

Most galaxies, including our own, formed within a few billion years of the Big Bang.

\subsection{The Birth of Stars}
A star is {\bf born} when gravity compresses the material in a cloud of gas and dust until it is dense and hot enough to generate energy through {\bf nuclear fusion}. The star lives so long as it has useable material to fuel its fusion and dies once it runs out.

A star {\bf dies} by blowing much of its remaining content back into space in a {\bf supernova}. This matter eventually becomes new stars and planets.

\subsection{Modelling the Universe}
\subsubsection{Distance}
We can imagine our solar system shrunk down to a manageable size. On the {\bf Voyage} scale (a model solar system in Washington, D.C. where sizes are one billionth of the actual size), the Sun is roughly the size of a grapefruit, Jupiter the size of a marble, Earth the size of a pinhead. Obviously the Sun is far larger than any planet, in fact, it has more than 1000 times as much mass as all the planets in our system combined. Note that the planets also vary in size to a large extent: the ``permanent'' storm on Jupiter known as the {\bf Giant Red Spot} is larger than the Earth.

We can also use this model to describe the distances between objects. On the same scale, the Earth is 15m from the Sun and the distance from the Sun to pluto is 600m. To have enough space for the orbit of each object in the system, we would need a grid of 300 football fields centered around the Sun.

The closest star (Alpha Centauri) is incredibly far away, on this scale it would be the difference between Washington, D.C. and California.

If we reduce this scale by another factor of one billion, we can start thinking about the size of the galaxy. On this scale, each light year is roughly a millimeter and the Milky Way is about the size of a football field. The distance between our star system and Alpha Centauri is smaller than the width of our pinky.

\subsubsection{Time}
We can also model the time between events by creating a {\bf cosmic calendar}. If we set the Big Bang as January $1^{st}$ and the present day as Decembre $31^{st}$, we can place each major event on specific days. By the age of the universe, each month represents just over a billion years.

On this scale, the Milky Way was formed sometime in February. Our solar system, though was, only formed in September -- life on Earth flourished by the end of that month. Recognizeable animals only appeared in mid-December. Dinosaurs first appeared the day after Christmas and died off yesterday. Around 9PM today, early hominids began to walk upright.

The entire history of human civilization, then, occurred in the last half-minute of January $31^{st}$.The Egyptians built the pyramids in 11 seconds, Galileo proved the Earth orbited the Sun one second ago, and the average college student was born 0.05 seconds ago.

\subsection{Motion of the Universe}
The Earth has a daily rotation (its {\bf spin}) and a yearly {\bf orbit} (or {\bf revolution}) around the Sun.

The Earth rotates each day around its {\bf axis}, the imaginary line from the North to the South pole. It rotates from West to East -- counter-clockwise when viewed from above the North pole. The speed is substantial; anywhere other than near the axes, an object whirls around the Earth at a speed greater than 1000km/h.

The Earth's average orbital distance is one {\bf Astronomical Unit} (AU), which is approximately 150 million kilometers. At times, we race around the Sun in excess of one hundred thousand kilometers per hour.

Earth's orbital path defines the {\bf eliptic plane}, and its axis is tilted by 23.5 degrees from a line perpendicular to this plane. The {\bf axis tilt} happens to align our north pole with Polaris, the North Star.

Note that the Earth orbits the Sun in the same direction as it spins around its axis since it was formed from a spinning disk and both of these rotations are a remnant of this.

We also move relative to nearby stars at a rate of $70,000$ kilometers per hour. We rotate around the Milky Way's galactic center once every 230 million years, which implies speeds of (on average) $800,000$ kilometers per hour.

\subsection{Dark Matter and Dark Energy}
Since stars at different distance from the galactic center orbit at different speeds, we can learn how mass is distributed in the galaxy by measuring the differing speeds. Studies show that the mass of the stars in the galactic disk form only a small percentage of the total mass of the galaxy. Most of the galactic mass, then, seems to be located outside of the visible disk in the galaxy's {\bf halo}. We call this mass {\bf dark matter}, since we have not observed light being emitted from it. Similarly, we find that the bulk of the energy in the universe is {\bf dark energy}. This seems to be the case in all observable galaxies.

\subsection{Relative Galactic Movements}
Within the local group, some galaxies move toward us and some move away. Outside of the local group, though, this changes; virtually every galaxy outside of the local group seems to be racing away from us at a speed proportional to its distance from us. This is the basis of our theory that of an {\bf expanding universe}: that the space between galaxies is increasing.

Note that we observe this motion by measuring {\bf Doppler shifts}, as detecting any difference in celestial position within our lifetimes is impossible.

\section{Chapter 2 -- Discovering the Universe}
\subsection{The Motion of the Stars}
Stars appear to move across the sky from east to west. This is not, as the ancients believed, because everything revolves around the Earth, but because the Earth is rotating. This rotation is not perfect though, because the Earth is tilted.

Some stars (those near the celestial north pole) do not rise or set; they remain above the horizon and make daily counter-clockwise circles around the pole. These stars are called {\bf circumpolar} stars. Other stars (those near the celestial south pole) never rise at all. All other stars appear to rise and set each day.

\subsection{Constellations}
Although we have a colloquial definition of constellations, astronomers more precisely declare {\bf constellations} to be regions of the sky with well-defined borders. The patterns of stars which ``form'' constellations simply help us to locate them.

There are 88 official constellations which cover the night sky, as determined by a 1928 summit including members of the International Astronomical Union. Every part of the sky is located within one of these constellations.

Though the stars are very far away, the ancient Greeks believed they were all ``painted'' on a {\bf celestial sphere} centered around the Earth. We use this today to help us map out space:
\begin{itemize}
\item the {\bf north celestial pole} is directly above the north pole, and
\item the {\bf south celestial pole} is directly above the south pole, and
\item the {\bf celestial equator} mirrors the real equator, and
\item the {\bf ecliptic} is the path the Sun takes as it appears to circle around the celestial sphere yearly. It crosses the celestial equator at a 23.5 degree angle
\end{itemize}

The {\bf Milky Way} traces a complete circle around the celestial sphere, moving through many constellations. It is almost, but not quite, repesentative of the Milky Way \emph{Galaxy}: it traces our galaxy's disk of stars as it appears from our location in the outskirts of the galaxy. The Milky Way appears somewhat wider as we look through Sagittarius since this is the direction of the galactic center.

Note that when looking above you at the {\bf local sky}, you can (obviously) only see one hemisphere of the celestial sphere at a time. We define the Earth-sky boundary as the {\bf horizon}, the point directly overhead as the {\bf zenith}, and an imaginary semi-circle passing along the sphere from due north to due south through the zenith as the {\bf meridian}.

We can locate any object by its direction along the horizon and its altitude above the horizon. We also sometimes use the {\bf azimuth} -- the angular distance clockwise from due north.

We can define the {\bf angular size} of an object as the angle it appears to span within our field of view. Since this depends on distance, it does not give us a clear idea of an object's true size; for example, the angular size of both the Sun and the Moon is half a degree despite the Sun being about 400 times larger (since the Sun is 400 times farther away).

The {\bf angular distance} between two objects is the number of degrees which appears to separate them. The distance between the pointer stars in the big dipper is roughly 5 degrees. We further divide each degree into 60 {\bf arcminutes} -- and then each of those into 60 {\bf arcseconds} -- for precision.

\subsubsection{Variance}
Constellations vary with both our north-south location on Earth as well as the time of year.

{\bf Latitude} affects the constellations by changing the locations of the horizon and zenith of our local sky. In effect, by moving to the north or south we can change which portion of the celestial sphere is visible. We can also use this effect to prove that \emph{the altitude of the celestial pole in your sky is equal to your latitude}.

The constellations vary over the course of the year due to Earth's changing position around the Sun. As we orbit, the Sun appears to move across the eliptic such that different stars are behind it at different times of the year. The constellations along this eliptic make up the {\bf zodiac}, the thirteen most widely known constellations (traditionally, there are twelve zodiacs; however, Ophiuchus is also present in the eliptic).

\subsection{Seasons}
The seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis. In effect, the axis remains pointing at a specific direction in space at all times. This, of course, means it is pointing at different points relative to the Sun throughout the year. The Northern Hemisphere is tipped toward the sun in their summer (June), and vice-versa. This causes the Sun's rays to hit the ``closer'' hemisphere for a longer time each day during their summer, as well as concentrating its rays, thus making it warmer.

Note that the common assumption is the summer occurs when the Earth is closer to the Sun than it is during winter. This is incorrect; in fact, the orbital distance between the Earth and the Sun \emph{does} vary, but only by approximately $3\%$. This difference does not cause noticeable temperature changes.

\subsubsection{Solstices}
We mark the special celestial events each year as the {\bf solstices} and {\bf equinoxes}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the {\bf summer (June) solstice} occurs around June $21^{st}$. It is the moment in which the Norther Hemisphere is tipped most directly toward the Sun.
\item the {\bf winter solstice} occurs around December $21^{st}$ and is precisely the opposite of the summer solstice.
\item the {\bf spring equinox} occurs around March $21^{st}$ and is the moment at which the Northern Hemisphere switchees from being slightly tipped away from the Sun to slightly toward the Sun.
\item the {\bf fall equinox} occurs around September $22^{nd}$ and is precisely the opposite of the spring equinox.
\end{itemize}

The exact dates vary each year by no more than a few days in either direction. In fact, our leap year system is designed precisely to ensure this is true.

The equinoxes are the only days of the year in which the Sun rises and sets exactly due East and West, as well as being the only days in which an equal amount of sunlight falls on both Hemispheres. The Sun rises and sets farther to the North on the Summer solstice side of the equinoxes, and farther South on the Winter solstice side.

We usually consider the solstices and equinoxes as the first day of the new season, despite the summer solstice, for example, being the longest day of the year -- ie. the midpoint of summer? This is generally due to weather patterns; the solstices and equinoxes match the beginning of the new season's weather patterns. We also find the it takes some time to match the temperature of the Earth to the Sun's location, thus making us feel a lag behind what the Sun implies our temperature should be.

Note that te solstices are named opposite to the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere. For the equator, we find that the rainy seasons occur at the equinoxes and the dry seasons occur at the solstices.

\subsection{Precession}
{\bf Precession} is a slow wobble of the Earth's tilt which affects our orientation in space. Each precession cycle takes approximately $26,000$ years and slowly changes where our poles point to in space. Today, our axis points toward Polaris, which we call the North Star. In approximately $13,000$ years, Vega will be in this location (ie. a bright star very near the pole's zenith). Most of the time, there is no North Star.

Precession, though, does not change the amount of tilt we have relative to the eliptic; we always have a 23.5 degree tilt, and so our seasons are not affected by precession.

Precession is caused by the effect of gravity on a rotating object which is not a perfect sphere. For the Earth, precession is caused by the competing effects of gravity from the Sun and the Moon attempting to ``straighten out'' our bulging equator.

\subsection{The Moon}
The Moon orbits the Earth once every $27.\bar{3}$ days. We can see that the Moon appears to move across the sky at half a degree (it's angular size) per hour. As it moves across the sky, its appearance and rising / setting times change according to its {\bf lunar phase}, which is based on its position relative to the Sun as it orbits the Earth.

The change of appearance is based on the direction the Sun casts its light from. When the Moon, Earth, and Sun form a right-angle, the Sun casts its light in such a way that only half of the Moon is illuminated from the Earth's perspective. The lunar cycle takes $29.5$ days to complete.

The Moon appears to fill in illumination starting from the right, then lose illumination from the same direction. We refer to completely dark Moons as {\bf New Moons} and completely illuminated ones as {\bf Full Moons}. {\bf Crescent Moons} and {\bf Gibbous Moons} (barely illuminated and almost fully illuminated, respectively) are refered to as {\bf waxing} or {\bf waning} depending on whether it is between a New Moon and a Full Moon or vice-versa. Half-illuminated Moons are referred to as the {\bf First and Third Quarter Moons}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Eclipses}
Eclipses occur when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned. A {\bf lunar eclipse} occurs when the Earth lies between the other two, such that the Earth's shadow falls on and blacks out the Moon. A {\bf solar eclipse} occurs when the Moon lies between the Sun and the Earth, so that the Moon block's our view of the Sun (ie. its shadow falls on us).

Since the Moon's orbit is slightly (5 degrees) inclined, eclipses do not happen each month. Eclipses, then, only occur when the Moon passes through the ecliptic; the two locations in which it does are referred to as the {\bf nodes} of its orbit. These times are called {\bf eclipse seasons}, and occur twice per year.

A lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon occurs near a node, a solar eclipse occurs when a new moon occurs near a node.

Since the Moon's shadow has both an {\bf umbra} -- the central area which completely blocks sunlight -- and a {\bf penumbra} -- which only partially blocks sunlight -- these eclipse can look extremely different. If the three objects line up perfectly, we can have a {\bf total lunar eclipse}, in which the Moon is completely blocked during the period of {\bf totality}. More likely is a {\bf partial eclipse}, which only hides a portion of the Moon. Finally, we have {\bf penumbral lunar eclipses}, which shade the Moon but do not completely blot it out.

During totality, the Moon is completely dark for typically less than an hour, save for the red ring around it formed because Earth's atmosphere bends some of the Sun's light toward the Moon (and, to a far lesser extent, due to {\bf gravitational lensing}).

Similarly, we have total and partial solar eclipses based on whether you are within the Moon's umbra or penumbra. When the Moon is too far away for its umbra to even reach the Earth, we see an {\bf annular eclipse}: a ring of sunlight surrounding the Moon when we are directly behind the umbra; otherwise, we see a partial eclipse.

Since the umbra moves across the Earth at a speed of $1,700$ km/h, an eclipse can last no more than a few minutes for any given location on Earth.

The location of the nodes in the Moon's orbit slowly change over time. This gives us an eclipse cycle of 18 years 11.3 days; we call this the {\bf Saros Cycle}. Of course, this only tells us when eclipses will occur, not where they will be visible from on Earth or whether they will be total or partial.

\subsection{Planets}
We can see five planets with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Mercury is rarely visiable, and only near sunrise or sunset. Venus can often be seen shining brightly in the evening (in the West) or before dawn (in the East). Jupiter, when visible, is the brightest star at night. Mars is often recognizeable by its red hue. Saturn has no distinguishing features, but can be identified with star charts.

Planets have different paths of motion that do stars, which is why the word for planet in Greek means ``wandering star''. The planets usually move Eastward through constellations, but sometimes go through periods of {\bf apparent retrograde motion} for anywhere between a few weeks and a few months. This retrograde motion occurs when the Earth ``passes'' the other planet, ie. when their orbits are in line with the Sun.

{\bf Stellar parallax} is the phenomenon of stars appearing to move at different rates given different angles; given the extremely great distances between us and the stars, this is not detectable by the human eye -- though it can be detected by telescopes.

\section{Chapter 3 -- Ancient Astronomy}
\subsection{Ancient Roots of Science}
Other lunar calendars remain roughly synchronized with solar calendars by taking advantage of an interesting coincidence: 19 years on a solar calendar is almost precisely 235 months on a lunar calendar. As a result, the lunar phases repeat on the same dates about every 19 years (a pattern known as the Metonic cycle).

The study of ancient structures in search of astronomical connections is called {\bf archaeoastronomy}

\subsection{Ancient Greek Science}
Greek - To account for the fact that the Sun and Moon each move gradually eastward through the constellations, the Greeks added separate spheres for them, with these spheres turning at different rates from the sphere of the stars. The planets also move relative to the stars, so the Greeks added additional spheres for each planet. The {\bf difficulty} with this model was that it made it hard to explain the apparent retrograde motion of the planets.

The {\bf Ptolemaic model} - Each planet moves on a small circle whose center moves around the Earth. A planet following this circle-upon-circle motion traces a loop as seen from Earth, with the backward portion of the loop mimicking apparent retrograde motion. Despite its complexity, the Ptolemaic model proved remarkably successful: It could correctly forecast future planetary positions to within a few degrees of arc.

\subsection{The Copernican Revolution}
Copernicus - Discovered simple geometric relationships that allowed him to calculate each planet’s orbital period around the Sun and its relative distance from the Sun in terms of Earth–Sun distance. The model’s success in providing a geometric layout for the solar system further convinced him that the Sun-centered idea must be correct.

Kepler’s key discovery was that planetary orbits are not circles but instead are a special type of oval called an ellipse. The locations of the two tacks are called the foci (singular, focus) of the ellipse. The long axis of the ellipse is called its major axis, each half is called the semimajor axis. A circle is an ellipse with zero
eccentricity, and greater eccentricity means a more elongated ellipse.

{\bf Kepler's first law} - The orbit of each planet about the sun is an elipse with the sun at one focus. It is closest at {\bf perihelion} and farthest at the point called the {\bf aphelion}.

{\bf Kepler's Second Law} - As a planets moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This
means the planet moves a greater distance when it is near perihelion than it does in the same amount of time near aphelion. That is, the planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun.

{\bf Kepler's Third Law} - More distant planets orbit the sun at slower average speeds. {\bf $p^2 = a^3$} p is the orbital period in years, and a is the distance from the sun. We can use the law to calculate a planet’s average orbital speed.

Galileo - observed four moons clearly orbiting Jupiter, not Earth. Soon thereafter, he observed that Venus goes through phases in a way that proved that it must orbit the Sun and not Earth.

Galileo’s experiments and telescopic observations overcame remaining objections to the Copernican idea of Earth
Venus as a planet orbiting the Sun. Although not everyone accepted his results immediately, in hindsight we see that
Galileo sealed the case for the Sun-centered solar system.

Science generally exhibits three hallmarks: (1) Modern science seeks explanations for observed phenomena that rely solely on natural causes. (2) Science progresses through the creation and testing of models of nature that explain the observations as simply as possible. (3) A scientific model must make testable predictions about natural phenomena that would force us to revise or abandon the model if the predictions do not agree with observations.

A {\bf scientific theory} is a simple yet powerful model that explains a wide variety of observations using just a few
general principles, and that has survived repeated and varied testing.

\section{Chapter 5 -- Light}
\begin{itemize}
\item light spectrum
\begin{itemize}
\item the range of visible light we see as we pass it through a prism
\item can be detailed enough to show us individual black bands representing missing colors
\end{itemize}
\item electromagnetic spectrum: the complete version of all light forms. visible light is only tiny fraction
\item wave properties
\begin{itemize}
\item a wave is something that can transmit energy without having to carry material with it
\item wavelength: the distance between adjacent peaks (measured in m)
\item frequency: the number of cycles per second (measured in Hz)
\item since light can affect both charged particles and magnets, we refer to it as an electromagnetic wave
\end{itemize}
\item All light travels at the same speed: $3*10^8 m/s$
\item particle properties
\begin{itemize}
\item comes in pieces called photons
\end{itemize}
\item gamma | x-ray | ultraviolet | visible | infrared | microwave | radio
\item atomic structure
\begin{itemize}
\item protons, neutrons, electrons
\item some really obvious shit
\item strong nuclear force holds protons and neutrons together at the nucleus
\item electrons in an atom a cloud that surrounds the nucleus and gives the atom its apparent size
\item it is impossible to pinpoint their positions
\item isotopes: atoms with varying numbers of neutrons
\end{itemize}
\item light and matter interact in four ways
\begin{enumerate}
\item emission: matter creates light (eg thermal, electrical potential)
\item absorption: light's energy is absorbed into matter (typically as thermal)
\item transmission: matter allowing light to pass through
\item reflection: light bouncing (scattering is reflecting randomly)
\end{enumerate}
\item transparent: material allows light to pass through
\item opaque: material absorbs all light
\item some materials treat certain light differently (eg red glass allows red light through, grass reflects green light)
\item types of spectrum
\begin{itemize}
\item continuous: broad range of wavelengths without interruption
\item emission line: light composed of individual bands (dependant on composition and temperature)
\item absorption line: broad range with individual bands missing
\end{itemize}
\item electrons can only have particular amount of energy and not levels inbetween (measured in eV)
\item 1 electron Volt = $1.60*10^{-19}$ Joule
\end{itemize}

These values are unique to every atom, ion, and molecule. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
A hydrogen atom has states:
    level 1: 0 eV   ground
          2: 10.2
          3: 12.1
          4: 12.8
 ionization: 13.6   escape
\end{verbatim}
% (((if possible, include figure 5.09 pg 119)))

\begin{itemize}
\item an electron rising or falling between levls are called energy level transitions
\item can only occur when an election gains or loses the specific amount of energy separating the two levels
\item electrons will not accept energy in quantities that do not correspond with an energy level (except escape, can go over)
\item each possible downward energy level transition (eg 3 to 1) corresponds to a release of energy in the form of photons
\item the more energy released, the shorter the photon wavelength
\item some of these transitions create photons with wavelengths that fall in the visible light spectrum (many won't be visible)
\item the exact possible emissions are unique to each atom, so we can use emission lines to identify compositions of light sources
\item electrons will not rest at high energy levels, they will fall back down quickly (fraction of a second)

\item energy exchanges typically caused by atoms colliding
\item most just bump away, a few transfer exactly the right amount of energy to an electron
\item collisions only keep happening while the gas is relatively hot
\item energy can also be recieved in these exact quantities by other photons
\item this causes absorption lines, since the photons that get absorbed then released will be in random directions
\item the photons that do not get absorbed travel straight through the material to us
\item most objects (eg rocks, plants, people) are complex enough that they absorb light from a very broad range
\item light cannot easily pass through, light emitted cannot easily escape
\end{itemize}

Consider an idealized case, an object absorbs all photons and does not allow photons inside it to escape easily. Photons bounce randomly around inside the object, constantly exchanging energy with its atoms or molecules. When photons finally escape the object, their radiative energies have become randomized so that they are spread over a wide range of wavelengths. This wide range explains why the spectrum of light from such an object is continuous, like a pure rainbow without any absorption or emission lines

\begin{itemize}
\item this all depends on the temperature of the object (the average kinetic energy of the atoms)
\item that's why this type of light is called thermal radiation

\section{Chapter 6 -- Formation of Planetary Solar Systems}
\subsection{Overview}
This chapter is about the nature of our solar system and current scientific ideas about its birth. We will also examine characteristics about our solar system that are key clues about how it formed. Finally it will talk about how astronomers have discovered other planets around other stars and how those planetary systems are helping us understand our own.

\subsection{Clues to the formation of the Solar System}
The Solar System's layout and composition offer 4 clues as to how it was born.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Large bodies in the solar system have orderly motions}.
\begin{itemize}
\item All planets have nearly circular orbits going in the same direction in nearly the same plane.
\item  All planets {\bf orbit} the Sun in the same direction: {\bf counterclockwise} as viewed from high above Earth’s North Pole.
\item Most planets rotate in the same direction in which they orbit, with fairly small axis tilts. The Sun also rotates in this direction.
\item Most of the solar system’s large moons exhibit similar properties in their orbits around their planets, such as orbiting in their plane
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Planets fall into two major categories}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Terrestrial planets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Small in mass and size
\item Close to the sun
\item Made of metal and rock
\item Few moons and no rings
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Jovian planets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Large in mass and size
\item Far from the Sun
\item Made from H, He and hydrogen compounds
\item rings and many moons
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Swarms of asteroids and comets populate the solar system}. Vast numbers of rocky asteroids and icy comets are found throughout the solar system, but are concentrated in 3 distinct regions
\begin{itemize}
\item Most {\bf asteroids} orbit in the {\bf asteroid belt} between Mars and Jupiter
\item Many {\bf comets} are found in the {\bf Kuiper Belt} beyond Neptune's orbit
\item Even more {\bf comets} orbit the sun in the distant spherical region called the {\bf Oort Cloud} and only a rare few ever plunge into the inner solar system. May contain a trillion comets.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Several notable exceptions to these trends stand out}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Uranus's odd tilt} Uranus rotates nearly on its side compared to its orbit and its rings and major moons share this sideways orientation.
\item {\bf Earth's relatively large moon} Our moon is much larger in size than most other moons in comparison to their planets
\item {Venus' backwards rotation}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Sun}
The {\bf sun contains more than 99.8\% of the solar systems total mass}. (1000 times more massive than the rest of the solar system combined). The surface is a sea of rolling hot (5800K) Hydrogen and Helium gas. The sun is gaseous throughout and temperture and pressure both increase with depth. In addition, charged particles moving outward ({\bf Solar wind}) help shape planetary magnetic fields and can influence planetary atmospheres.

\subsection{Mercury}
A desolate, cratered world with no active volcanoes, no wind, no rain, and no life. It is a world of both {\bf hot and cold extremes}. The combination of rotation and orbit gives Mercury days and nights that last about 3 Earth months each. Mercury’s {\bf surface is heavily cratered} But it also shows evidence of past geological activity, such as plains created
by ancient lava flows and tall, steep cliffs that run hundreds of kilometers in length. Mercury’s {\bf high density} indicates that it has a very large iron core.

\subsection{Venus}
Venus is nearly identical in size to Earth. It {\bf rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction of Earth}, so days and nights are very long. An {\bf extreme greenhouse effect} bakes Venus’s surface to an incredible 470°C. Day and night. Venus has {\bf mountains, valleys, and craters, and shows many signs of past or present volcanic activity}. But Venus also has geological features unlike any on Earth, and we see no evidence of Earth-like plate tectonics.

\subsection{Earth}
Only planet in our solar system with oxygen to breathe, ozone to shield the surface from deadly solar radiation, and abundant surface water to nurture life. Temperatures are pleasant because Earth’s atmosphere contains just enough carbon dioxide and water vapor to maintain a moderate greenhouse effect.

\subsection{Mars}
Mars has ancient volcanoes. The presence of dried-up riverbeds, rock-strewn floodplains, and minerals that form in water offers clear evidence that Mars had at least some warm and wet periods in the past. Major flows of liquid water probably ceased at least 3 billion years ago. More than a dozen spacecraft have flown past, orbited, or landed on Mars.

\subsection{Jupiter}
Most famous feature: long-lived storm called the Great Pluto. {\bf Made primarily of hydrogen and helium and has no solid surface}. Increasing gas pressure would crush us long before we ever reached its core. Jupiter reigns over dozens of moons and a thin set of rings (too faint to be seen in most photographs).

\subsection{Saturn}
Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium and has no solid surface. The rings may look solid from a distance, but in reality they are made of countless small particles, each of which orbits Saturn. Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere. Saturn and its moons are so far from the Sun that Titan’s surface temperature is a
frigid -180°C.

\subsection{Uranus}
It is made largely of hydrogen, helium, and hydrogen compounds such as water (H 2 O), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4). Uranus lacks a solid surface. The entire Uranus system—planet, rings, and moon orbits—is tipped on its side compared to the rest of the planets and it gives Uranus the most extreme seasonal variations of any planet in our solar system.

\subsection {Neptune}
Neptune looks nearly like a twin of Uranus, although it is more strikingly blue. Smaller than Uranus but more massive due to higher density (even though they have similar composition. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that orbits its planet “backward”—that is, in a direction opposite to the direction in which Neptune rotates. This backward orbit makes it a near certainty that Triton once orbited the Sun independently before somehow being captured into Neptune’s orbit.

\subsection {Pluto (and other dwarf planets)}
Pluto is much smaller and less massive than any of the other planets, and its orbit is much more eccentric and inclined to the ecliptic plane. Its composition of ice and rock is also quite different from that of any of those planets, although it is virtually identical to that of many known comets. Pluto is not even the largest of Kuiper belt objects, Eris, is slightly larger than Pluto.

\subsection{Where did the solar system come from?}
The {\bf nebular theory} begins with the idea that our solar system was born from a cloud of gas, called the solar nebula, that collapsed under its own gravity. As the solar nebula shrank in size, three important processes altered its density, temperature, and shape, changing it from a large, diffuse (spread-out) cloud to a much smaller spinning disk: {\bf heating, spinning, flattening}. As it collapsed, it heated up, spun faster and flattened into a disk.

\subsubsection{The Formation of the planets}
In the center of the collapsing solar nebula, gravity drew together enough material to form the Sun. Because hydrogen and helium gas made up 98\% of the solar nebula’s mass and did not condense, the vast majority of the nebula remained gaseous at all times. However, other materials could condense wherever the temperature allowed.

The solid metal and rock in the inner solar system ultimately grew into the terrestrial planets we see today, but these planets ended up relatively small in size because rock and metal made up such a small amount of the material in the solar nebula. {\bf Accretion} The process in which small ``seeds'' grow into planets.

The leading model for jovian planet formation holds that these planets formed as gravity drew gas around ice-rich ``boulders'' much more massive than Earth. Their large masses had gravity strong enough to capture some of the hydrogen and
helium gas that made up the vast majority of the surrounding solar nebula. Ultimately, the jovian planets accreted so
much gas that they bore little resemblance to the icy seeds from which
they started.

The young Sun had a strong solar wind—strong enough to have swept huge quantities of gas out of the solar system, sealing the compositional fate of the planets.

Asteroids and comets are leftover and are less common than earlier in the solar systems life. Although impacts occasionally still occur, the vast majority of these collisions occurred in the first few hundred million years of our solar system’s history, during the period we call the {\bf heavy bombardment}. These impacts did more than just batter the planets. They also brought materials from other regions of the solar system. (Potentially bringing water to Earth)

\subsubsection{How do we explain the exceptions to rules?}
Our moon - The giant impact hypothesis holds that a Mars-size object hit Earth at a speed and angle that blasted Earth’s outer layers into space. Strong support for this comes from two features of the moon's composition.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The composition of the moon is similar to Earth's outer layers
\item The Moon has a much smaller proportion of easily vaporized ingredients (such as water) than Earth. This fact supports the hypothesis because the heat of the impact would have vaporized these ingredients.
\end{enumerate}

Other Exceptions
\begin{itemize}
\item Mercury’s surprisingly high density may be the result of a giant impact that blasted away its outer, lower-density layers.
\item Giant impacts could have also been responsible for tilting the axes of many planets (including Earth) and perhaps for tipping Uranus on its side
\item Venus’s slow and backward rotation could also be the result of a giant impact
\end{itemize}
Nebular Theory accounts for {\bf all FOUR} of the major features of the solar system.

\subsubsection{When did the Planet's form?}
The planets begin to form just over {\bf 4.5 billion years ago}

\subsubsection{Other Planetary Systems}
We can detect planets in other stars directly (pictures) or indirectly (measurements of a stars properties).

Indirect Methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Astrometric Technique} - we make very precise measurements of stellar positions in the sky. If a star “wobbles” gradually around its average position (the center of mass), we must be observing the influence of unseen planets.
\item {\bf Doppler technique} searches for a star’s orbital movement around the center of mass by looking for changing Doppler shifts in a star’s spectrum. Used for the majority of planet discoveries to date
\item {\bf Transits and Eclipses} searching for slight changes in a star’s brightness that
occur when a planet passes in front of or behind it. The transit method can also be used to search simultaneously for planets around vast numbers of stars and to detect much smaller planets than is possible with the Doppler technique.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparing Extrasolar planets}
\subsubsection*{Orbits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most of the planets orbit very close to their host star
\item many of the orbits are elliptical instead of nearly circular like the orbits of planets in our own solar system
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Masses}
Most of the known extrasolar planets are more massive than Jupiter, smallest is twice the mass of Earth

\section{Chapter 18 -- Life in the Universe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reasons why life likely might exist elsewhere
\begin{itemize}
\item Life arose quite quickly on Earth, so why not on other planets too
\item Chemicals on young Earth combined readily into complex organic compounds.  This may also be true on other exoplanets.
\item We have discovered microorganisms that could survive on other planets in our solar system
\end{itemize}
\item Timeline of development of life on Earth:\\
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Years ago & Event \\ \hline
    4.5 billion & Earth and moon form\\
    3.85 billion & Carbon isotope evidence of life\\
    3.5 billion & Oldest microfossil evidence of life\\
    2.5 billion & earliest evidence of oxygen in the atmosphere\\
    410 million & animals colonize land\\
    230 million & mammals and dinosaurs appear \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\item Requirements for life (on Earth)
\begin{itemize}
\item A source of nutrients
\item Energy to fuel the activities of life
\item Liquid water (* this is the only one that is difficult to achieve)
\end{itemize}
\item Microbes living in extreme conditions (volcanic vents, deserts) imply that if not for a need for water life could exist almost anywhere
\item Only likely candidates to have liquid water in our solar system are Mars and some jovian moons (e.g. Europa)
\item What properties must a star system have to contain life
\begin{itemize}
\item It must be older than several million years (that's how long life took to form after Earth's formation)
\item The star must not be much bigger than our Sun, because it would die off before life formed (still leaves about 99\% of stars)
\item Planets must have stable orbits (far less likely in binary star systems, but not impossible)
\item Bigger star means larger habitable zone (the zone where liquid water could exist)
\end{itemize}
\item A planet's spectra can give us the atmospheric makeup, allows us to look for water vapour, ozone, methane, etc.
\item Rare-Earth hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item The galaxy has a habitable zone, just like our solar system
\item Star systems further out contain far less non-hydrogen/helium elements, which almost completely compose terrestrial planets
\item Inner systems are subject to far more high supernovae, which would likely irradiate life
\item Leaves only about 10\% of solar systems habitable
\item Impact rate in our solar system dropped off quickly, is the same true everywhere?  In our solar system this was due to jovian planets ejecting small objects from the inner solar system
\item Our atmosphere has been relatively stable due to plate tectonics (which might be rare on other planets) regulating the carbon dioxide, and our large moon regulates our axial tilt
\end{itemize}
\item Counter-arguments include
\begin{itemize}
\item Earth is very small and wouldn't need a high abundance of heavy elements to form (relative to the mass of the star)
\item We don't know if a supernova would be harmful to life
\item If the Earth rotated faster it would also regulate our axial tilt without the Moon
\item Large moons could exist other places, ours isn't that rare
\item Life could adapt to a changing axial tilt
\end{itemize}
\item Drake equation: Number of civilizations = $N_\text{HP} * f_\text{life} * f_\text{civ} * f_\text{now}$
\begin{description}
\item[$N_\text{HP}$] number of habitable planets in the galaxy that \emph{could} have life
\item[$f_\text{life}$] fraction of habitable planets that actually have life
\item[$f_\text{civ}$] fraction of life-bearing planets upon which a civilization capable of interstellar communication \emph{has at some time} arisen
\item[$f_\text{now}$] fraction of civilization-bearing planets that currently have such a civilization
\end{description}
\item Fermi paradox: If it's so likely that other civilizations exist than there are some millions of years ahead of us technologically.  So where are they?  Options: ``we're alone'', ``every other civilization destroyed itself before it could settle the galaxy'' or ``they haven't revealed themselves to us yet''
\end{itemize}


\section{Assignments}
\subsection{Assignment 1}
{\bf Distance from Earth} (furthest to closest): Andromeda, far side of the milky way, near side of the milky way, orion nebula, Alpha Centauri, Pluto, The Sun

If an object is 10 light-years away, then we see it as it was 10 years ago, but if it is 20 light-years away, we see it as it was 20 years ago. In other words, more distant objects have aged more since their light left on its way to Earth.

Timeline: Universe begins to expand, Elements such as carbon and Oxygen first form, nuclear fusion begins in the Sun, Earliest life on Earth

Our cosmic address: Earth, solar system, Milky Way Galaxy, Local Group, Local Supercluster, universe

We cannot See a Universe that is 20 billion years away because it is not in our observable universe

\subsection{Assignment 2}
The {\bf Tilt of a planet is responsible for seasons}. Jupiter (3*) has almost no seasons compared to Uranus (97*). Earth and Mars have a similar tilt.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Time of Year & Earth-Sun Distance \\ \hline
March (Northern Spring Equinox) & 149.0 million km\\
June (Northern Summer Solstice) & 152.0 million km\\
September (Northern Fall Equinox & 150.2 million km\\
December (Northern Winter Solstice) & 147.2 million km\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Earth is actually farthest from the Sun when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere. We conclude that variations in the Earth-Sun distance from are not the major cause of our seasons.

The {\bf Moon’s orbit about Earth is tilted} (by about 5°) with respect to Earth’s orbit about the Sun. As a result, the actual number of solar eclipses that occur each year is approximately 2 (instead of one each month)

Apparent {\bf retrograde motion can be observed by noticing changes in Mars's position among the constellations}. Note that a complete period of apparent retrograde motion unfolds while Earth moves a significant fraction of its orbit, which means it takes several months. Apparent retrograde motion occurs as Earth ``laps'' Mars in their respective orbits around the Sun. The middle of a period of apparent retrograde motion occurs when Mars is closest to Earth in its orbit and in a full phase as viewed from Earth, which is why it is brightest in our sky at that time. It is also directly opposite the Sun in the sky at that time, which is why it crosses the meridian at midnight.

The {\bf Greeks explained retrograde motion by imagining that planets moved around small circles that in turn moved around larger circles around Earth}. Because this model made reasonably accurate predictions of planetary positions and fit with other philosophical ideas that they held, the Greeks had no compelling reason to reject it,

{\bf Random}: How frequently does the Galactic Center (in the constellation Sagittarius) and the Sun align, that is, appear in the same constellation? Once A year

Neutrinos rarely interact with anything on Earth (faulty premise of movie 2012)

\subsection{Assignment 3}
{\bf Kepler's second} law tells us that as an object moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times

{\bf Venus} is full whenever it is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, although we cannot see the full Venus because it is close to the Sun in the sky. For Venus to be high in the sky at midnight, it would have to be on the opposite side of our sky from the Sun. But that never occurs, because Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun.

{\bf Falsifiable}: (could be proven false)

True Statements belong in Sun centered and ``Both'' models

{\bf Earth Centered Model Only}
\begin{itemize}
\item A planet beyond Saturn rises in east and sets in West
\end{itemize}

{\bf Sun Centered Only}
\begin{itemize}
\item Positions of nearby stars shift back and forth slightly each year
\item Mercury goes thorough a full cycle of phases
\end{itemize}

{\bf Both Models}
\begin{itemize}
\item Moon rises in east and sets in west
\item A distant galaxy rises in the east and sets in the west
\item stars circle daily around north and south celestial pole
\end{itemize}

{\bf Neither Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item We sometimes see a crescent Jupiter
\end{itemize}

An object must come between Earth and the Sun for us to see it in a crescent phase, which is why we see crescents only for Mercury, Venus, and the Moon.

{\bf Greek geocentric model}, the retrograde motion of a planet occurs when the planet actually goes {\bf backward in its orbit around Earth }

{\bf Random:} Copernicus's Sun-centered model did not make significantly better predictions of planetary positions in our sky. (not an advantage of it)

{\bf Tides:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Any particular location on Earth has two high tides and two low tides each day.
\item Tides also affect land, although not as much
\item One tide bulge faces the moon, the other is away from
\item The second tidal bulge arises because gravity weakens with distance, essentially stretching Earth along the Earth-Moon line.
\item High tides are highest at both full moon and new moon
\item Low tides are lowest at both full moon and new moon.
\item Moon is larger factor than the sun because gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon varies more across Earth than does the gravitational attraction between Earth and the Sun
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignment 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Sun emits all colors of visible light, but cooler gasses on the Sun's surface absorb some of these colors.
\item The most intense color in an absorption spectrum can tell us the temperature of an object.
\item {\bf Wien's Law}: thermal radiation from a higher object peaks at a shorter wavelength.
\item Electrons lose energy exactly equal to the proportion of distance between ``rings'' they jump, regardless of which rings they traverse.
\item Visible light and radio waves reach the Earth's surface, infrared light reaches mountain tops, UV light reaches the upper atmosphere, and X-rays don't enter the atmosphere.
\item The light-carrying area of a telescope varies at a rate double its diameter.
\item The Hubble Telescope has a resolution of less than 0.1 arcseconds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignment 5}
Jovian planets \underline{\hspace{5em}} than terrestrial planets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Are more massive
\item Are lower in average density
\item Are bigger
\item Orbit the Sun farther
\item Have more moons
\item Have rings
\end{itemize}

How are Pluto and Eris different from other planets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Smaller
\item More elliptical orbits
\item Less massive
\item Similar composition to comets (ice and rock)
\end{itemize}

Characteristics of planets in our solar system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Large bodies have orderly motions
\item There are exceptions to most trends
\begin{itemize}
\item Venus spins backwards
\item Uranus rotates on its side (axial tilt $\approx 90^\circ$)
\item The moon is about $\frac{1}{4}$ the size of Earth
\end{itemize}
\item Planets orbit the Sun in the same plane
\item Planets closer to the Sun move  around their orbits at higher speed than planets farther from the Sun
\item All the planet (not counting Pluto) have nearly circular orbits
\end{itemize}

Small bodies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rocky = asteroids
\begin{itemize}
\item Found in the asteroid belt
\end{itemize}
\item Icy = comets
\begin{itemize}
\item Found in the Kuiper belt (starts around Neptune, extends past Pluto) and Oort cloud (sphere around the solar system, far beyond Pluto)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Detecting extrasolar planets
\begin{itemize}
\item Planets are very dim compared to their star, it makes it very hard to image them visually.  The angular separation from Earth is also very small.
\item We can detect planets by watching how their star ``wobbles'' due to their gravity (Doppler technique).  This technique can only give us the \textbf{minimum} mass of the planet (unless it's on the same plane as the Earth)
\item Smaller orbital radius of planet results in higher max speed of the star and shorter period of rotation
\item Mass of the planets only affects the max speed of the star in its ``wobble''
\item If the planets orbital plane lie between the Earth and the star we can see eclipses --- a slight dip in the stars luminosity
\item As of 2008, the most extrasolar planets have been discovered by the Doppler technique
\item The Kepler mission mostly looked for eclipses
\item Transit technique has the best chance of finding Earth-like planets
\item The astrometric technique uses careful measurements of positions of celestial bodies to find planets
\end{itemize}

Properties of extrasolar planets (discovered so far):
\begin{itemize}
\item Some jovian planets have been found closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun (hot Jupiters)
\item Many are on very eccentric orbits
\item Jovian planets migrate closer to their star from their original orbits
\item Most are larger than Jupiter
\end{itemize}

Four process that shape planetary surfaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item Impact cratering
\begin{itemize}
\item number of impacts per square area about the same for all planets
\item Mostly occurs in the first few hundred million years after formation
\item Primary factor for craters still being visible is if they've been erased, because they were definitely there at some point
\end{itemize}
\item Volcanism
\begin{itemize}
\item Outgassing explains how terrestrial planets got their atmospheres
\end{itemize}
\item Tectonics
\begin{itemize}
\item Happens beneath the \emph{lithosphere}, the rigid layer of rock at the surface of a planet
\item Compression causes mountain ranges
\item Extension (stretching) causes cracks and valleys
\item Earth is the only planet where the lithosphere has been broken into plates
\item Lots of tectonic activity means lots of volcanic activity
\item Can only occur if the interior of the planet is liquid (hot!)
\item Big planets take longer to cool than small ones, so they have tectonic activity for longer
\end{itemize}
\item Erosion
\begin{itemize}
\item Occurs due to surface liquids, ices and gases
\item Liquid water is the best, causes much more pronounced features
\item Canyons (formed by glaciers), dunes, rock formations
\item Planet must be warm enough to have liquids, and big enough to capture an atmosphere
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Definitions}
\subsection{Basic Astronomical Objects}
\begin{description}
\item[star] is a large, glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light through nuclear fusion in its core. Our Sun is a star.
\item[planet] is a moderately large object that orbits a star and shines primarily by reflecting light from its star. According to a definition
approved in 2006, an object can be considered a planet only if it (1) orbits a star; (2) is large enough for its own gravity to make
it round; and (3) has cleared most other objects from its orbital path. An object that meets the first two criteria but has not
cleared its orbital path, like Pluto, is designated a dwarf planet.
\item[moon (or satellite)] is an object that orbits a planet. The term satellite can refer to any object orbiting another object.
asteroid A relatively small and rocky object that orbits a star.
\item[comet] is a relatively small and ice-rich object that orbits a star.
\item[extrasolar planet] is a planet that orbits a star that is not our Sun.

\item[solar system] is the Sun and all the material that orbits it, including the planets, dwarf planets, and small solar system bodies. Although the term solar system technically refers only to our own star system (solar means “of the Sun”), it is often applied to other star systems as well.
\item[star system] is a star (sometimes more than one star) and any planets and other materials that orbit it.
\item[galaxy] is a great island of stars in space, containing from a few hundred million to a trillion or more stars, all held together by gravity and
orbiting a common center.
\item[cluster (or group) of galaxies] is a collection of galaxies bound together by gravity. Small collections (up to a few dozen galaxies)
are generally called groups, while larger collections are called clusters.
\item[supercluster] is a gigantic region of space where many individual galaxies and many groups and clusters of galaxies are packed more
closely together than elsewhere in the universe.
\item[universe (or cosmos)] are the sum total of all matter and energy -- that is, all galaxies and everything between them.
observable universe The portion of the entire universe that can be seen from Earth, at least in principle. The observable universe is
probably only a tiny portion of the entire universe.
\end{description}

\subsection{Astronomical Distance Units}
\begin{description}
\item[astronomical unit (AU)] is the average distance between Earth and the Sun, which is about 150 million kilometers. More technically,
1 AU is the length of the semimajor axis of Earth’s orbit.
\item[light-year] is the distance that light can travel in 1 year, which is about 9.46 trillion kilometers.
\end{description}

\subsection{Terms Relating to Motion}
\begin{description}
\item[rotation] is the spinning of an object around its axis. For example, Earth rotates once each day around its axis, which is an imaginary
line connecting the North Pole to the South Pole.
\item[orbit (revolution)] is the orbital motion of one object around another. For example, Earth orbits around the Sun once each year.
\item[expansion (of the universe)] is the increase in the average distance between galaxies as time progresses. Note that while the universe as a whole is expanding, individual galaxies and galaxy clusters do not expand.
\item[Doppler shift] light is \textbf{bluer} if the object is moving \textbf{towards} the Earth, it is \textbf{redder} if the object is moving \textbf{away} from the Earth. The intensity of the light is related to the speed at which the object is moving toward / away from the Earth.
\end{description}

\subsection{Telescopes}
\begin{description}
\item[Diffraction limit] The angular resolution before interference of light itself causes problems
\end{description}


\section{Formulae and Values}
Our solar system was formed 4.5 billion years ago, when about $2\%$ of the galaxy's original Hydrogen and Helium had been converted to heavier elements. Thus the cloud which formed our galaxy was roughly $98\%$ Hydrogen and Helium. The $2\%$ of other materials form the core of the rocky planets in our systems, ie. the Earth.

The {\bf Andromeda galaxy} is roughly 2.5 million light-years away and about $100,000$ light-years in diameter. {\bf Sirius}, the brightest star visible in the night sky, is 8 light-years away. {\bf Alpha Centauri}, the closest star system to our own (a three star system), is 4.4 light-years away.

\begin{itemize}
\item $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
\item $v = \lambda f$
\item $\text{Energy} = h f = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$
\item $v_\text{radial} = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}\ c$
\item $F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
\item $p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{(M_1 + M_2) * G}\ a^3$ (in our solar system $\text{years}^2 = \text{A.U.}^3$)
\item $L = 4\pi^2R^2 \sigma_{SB} T^4$
\item Angular separation (rad) $= \frac{\text{semi-major axis (AU)}}{\text{distance parsecs}}$
\item $r_\text{planet} \approx r_\text{star} * \sqrt{\text{fraction of light blocked}}$
\item Eccentricity of an ellipse: $e = \frac{f}{a}$ where f is the distance from the center to a focus
\item $\text{momentum} = \text{mass} * \text{velocity}$
\item $\text{SA}_\text{sphere} = 4 \pi r^2$
\item $\lambda_\text{peak} T = 2.898 * 10^{-3} m \cdot K$
\item Time dilation: $t' = t * \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2}$
\item Length contraction: $l' = l * \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2}$
\item Mass increase: $m' = \dfrac{m}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2}}$
\item Angular size, physical size, and distance are related as $\frac{l_{angular}}{360} = \frac{l_{physical}}{2\pi d}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture Slides}
\subsection{Scale of the Universe}
\subsubsection{Objects in the Universe}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Star:  A large, glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light through nuclear fusion
    \item Planet: A moderately large object that orbits a star; it shines by reflected light. Planets may be rocky, icy, or gaseous in composition.
    \item Moon: An object that orbits a planet
    \item Asteroid: A relatively small and rocky object that orbits a star
    \item Comet: A relatively small and icy object that orbits a star
    \item Solar System: A star and all the material that orbits it, including its planets and moons
    \item Nebular: An interstellar cloud of gas and/or dust
    \item Galaxy: A great island of stars in space, all held together by gravity and orbiting a common center
    \item Universe: The sum total of all matter and energy; that is, everything within and between all galaxies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Light Travels}
Light travels at a finite speed (3000,000 km/s) so the farther away we look the farther back in time we look. Light years are distance light travels in a year (9,460,000,000,000 km).
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Destination} & \textbf{Light travel time}\\
    \hline
    Moon & 1s\\
    \hline
    Sun & 8s\\
    \hline
    Sirius & 8 years\\
    Andromeda & 2.5 million light years\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{The Universe is Big}
We can't see a galaxy 15 billion light years away (universe is 14 billion years old) because looking 15 billion light-years away means looking to a time before the universe existed.

If we reduce the size of the solar system by a factor of 10 billion the sun is the size of a grapefruit and earth is the size of a ball point (15m from the sun)and alpha centauri is 2500 miles away

The milky way galaxy has about 100 billion stars. There are around 100 billion galaxies in universe. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on earth. It would take more than 3000 years to count the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy at a rate of one per second, and they are spread across 100,000 light-years.

The matter in our bodies came from the Big  Bang, which produced hydrogen and helium. All other elements were constructed from H  and He in stars and then recycled into new  star systems, including our solar system. On a cosmic calendar that compresses the history of the universe into 1 year, human civilization is just a few seconds old, and a human lifetime is a fraction of a second.

\subsubsection{Earth Moves Through Space}
Earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 1AU = 150 million kilometers (at 107,000 km/h) and tilted by $23.5\,^{\circ}$ rotating clockwise.

The sun moves 70,000 km/h and orbits the galaxy every 230 million years.

Galaxies in our Local Group are moving away from us and the farther a galaxy is the faster it is moving, which implies that we live in an expanding universe.


\subsection{Discovering the Universe for Yourself}
\subsubsection{View from Earth}
With the naked eye we can see $>2000$ stars as well as the milky way. Some of these stars are sorted into 88 constellations. These lie on the celestial sphere (all stars lie on celestial sphere).
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{ecliptic} is the sun's apparent path through celestial sphere
    \item \textbf{north celestial pole} is directly above earth's north pole
    \item \textbf{celestial equator} is projection of earth's equator on celestial sphere
\end{itemize}
The milky way is a band of light making a circle around the celestial sphere (just our view into the plane of our galaxy).

\subsubsection{Local Sky}
An object's altitude (above horizon) and direction (along horizon) specify its location in your local sky.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{meridian}: line throuh zenith and connecting N and S points on horizon
    \item \textbf{zenith}: point directly overhead
    \item \textbf{horizon}: all points 90 degress from zenith
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measurements}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Angular size of sun & 0.5 degrees\\
    \hline
    Angular size of moon & 0.5 degrees\\
    \hline
    Width of finger &1 degree\\
    \hline
    Width of hand & 20 degrees \\
    \hline
    Width of fist & 10 degrees\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Arcminutes (denoted ') are 1/60 of a degree and arcseconds are 1/60 of arcminutes (denoted '').
\begin{center}
    angular size = physical size $\times \frac{360\,^{\circ}}{2\pi \times \text{distance}}$
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Star Rise}
Earth rotates west to east so starts appear to move east to west. Stars near the north pole are circumpolar and never set. Starts near south pole are not seen.
What constellations we see depends on latitude (but not longitude) because position on Earth determines which constellations remain below the horizon, and time of year because Earth's orbit changes the apparent location of the Sun among the stars.

The altitude of the celestial pole equals your latitude (ex if Polaris is $50\,^{\circ}$ above the horizon due north you are at latitude $50\,^{\circ}$N). All constellations move counter clockwise around Polaris.

\subsubsection{Seasons}
Direct sunlight heats more so in the summer we are angled toward the sun so we get more direct sunlight. Sun's position varies by season (summer has is higher). Earth's distance from Sun varies by at most 3\% so it cannot effect the temperature as much as the axis tilt can.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summer solstice: highest path (rise and set at most extreme north)
    \item Winter solstice: lowest path (rise and set at most extreme south) for this half of the year the sun's angle at north pole is less than 0
    \item Spring/Fall equinox: middle path (rise and set at exactly east and west) here the angle of sun at noon on north pole is earth's axis tilt.
\end{itemize}

Earth's axis rotates once every 26,000 years

\subsubsection{The Moon}
Moon's phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item new (6am to 6pm)
    \item waxing crescent (glowey bit on the right) (9am to 9pm)
    \item first quarter (noon to midnight)
    \item waxing gibbous (3pm to 3am)
    \item full (6pm to 6am)
    \item waning gibbous (9pm to 9am)
    \item last quarter (midnight to noon)
    \item waning crescent (glowey bit on the left) (3am to 3pm)
\end{itemize}

A lunar eclipse occurs when earth casts a shadown across the moon. \textbf{Penumbra} is a glowing ring around (due to light refraction) \textbf{umbra} which is strict shadow.
\begin{itemize}
    \item full lunar eclipse - moon passes through umbra
    \item partial lunar eclipse - moon partially passes through umbra
    \item penumbral lunar eclipse - moon passes through penumbra
\end{itemize}
Eclipses only occur wiht a full moon at night.

A solar eclipse only occurs at new moon during the day.

The Moon's orbit is tilted 5° to ecliptic plane. So we have about two eclipse seasons each year, with a lunar eclipse at new moon and solar eclipse at full moon.Eclipses recur with the 18-year, 11 1/3-day saros cycle, but type (e.g., partial, total) and location may vary.

\subsubsection{Ancient Planets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mercury
        \begin{itemize}
            \item difficult to see; always close to Sun in sky
         \end{itemize}
    \item Venus
        \begin{itemize}
            \item very bright when visible, morning or evening "star"
         \end{itemize}
    \item Mars
        \begin{itemize}
            \item noticeably red
         \end{itemize}
    \item Jupiter
        \begin{itemize}
            \item very bright
         \end{itemize}
    \item Saturn
        \begin{itemize}
            \item moderately bright
         \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Ancients saw planets that moved eastward relative to the starts but occasionally went backwards (called \textbf{retrograde}). Impossible to explain with geocentric universe. The greeks rejected the heliocentric universe because they couldn't observe the stellar paralax (difference in position of a star as seen from earth) because the change in distance was too small to be measured.

\subsection{Science of Astronomy}
The seven days of the week were named after the sun, moon, and five visible planets (tues-mars, wed-mercury, thurs-jupiter, fri-venus, sat-saturn).

Some ancient time peices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stonehenge
    \item Templo Mayor (mexico)
    \item Sun dagger marks solstice(US)
    \item Macchu Picu
    \item Polynesia were good celestial navigators
    \item China first to record supernovas
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ancient Greeks}
Greeks were the first people known to make models of nature. They tried to explain patterns in nature without resorting to myth or the supernatural.

Eratosthenes measured the size of earth in 240BC: Distance between two cities (Syene and Alexandria) was 5000 stadia, using a stick in a hole he could see that when the sun was directly overhead of alexandria it was off by 7 degrees in Syene. 7/360 * (circumference of earth) = 5000 stadia. Was only off by 2000km.

Greeks used geocentric model(heaves must be perfect with everything being perfect spheres and circles). This couldnt explain retrograde motion. Ptolemy came up with the most sphisticated geocentric model and it was accurate enough to be in use for 1500 years. He explained retrograde motion by having planets make little circles occasionally in their larger orbit of earth.

Which of the following is NOT a fundamental difference between the geocentric and Sun-centered models of the  solar system?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Earth is stationary in the geocentric model but moves around Sun in Sun-centered model.
    \item Retrograde motion is real (planets really go backward) in geocentric model but only apparent (planets don't really turn around) in Sun-centered model.
    \item Stellar parallax is expected in the Sun-centered model but not in the Earth-centered model.
    \item \textbf{F} The geocentric model is useless for predicting planetary positions in the sky, while even the earliest Sun-centered models worked almost perfectly.
\end{enumerate}

Greek knowledge was preserved through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Muslim world preserved and enhanced the knowledge they received from the Greeks.
    \item Al-Mamun's House of Wisdom in Baghdad was a great center of learning around A.D. 800.
    \item With the fall of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Eastern scholars headed west to Europe, carrying knowledge that helped ignite the European Renaissance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Copernican Revolution}
Copernicus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed a Sun-centered model (published 1543)
    \item Used model to determine layout of solar system (planetary distances in AU) But . . .
    \item The model was no more accurate than the Ptolemaic model in predicting planetary positions, because it still used perfect circles.
\end{itemize}
Tycho Brahe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compiled the most accurate (one arcminute) naked eye measurements ever made of planetary positions.
    \item Still could not detect stellar parallax, and thus still thought Earth must be at center of solar system (but recognized that other planets go around Sun).
    \item Hired Kepler, who used Tycho's observations to discover the truth about planetary motion.
\end{itemize}
Johannes Kepler:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kepler first tried to match Tycho's observations with circular orbits
    \item But an 8-arcminute discrepancy led him eventually to ellipses.
\end{itemize}
Kepler's laws:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The orbit of each planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus
    \item As a planet moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times  (means that a planet travels faster when it is nearer to the sun)
    \item More distant planets orbit the Sun at slower average speeds, obeying the relationship: $p^2 = a^3$ where p = orbital period in years and a = avg. distance from Sun in AU
\end{enumerate}
Gelileo fixed some flaws in Compernican revolution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Earth could not be moving because objects in air would be left behind.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Galileo's experiments showed that objects in air would stay with Earth as it moves, showed that objects will stay in motion unless a force acts to slow them down
    \end{itemize}
    \item Non-circular orbits are not "perfect" as heavens should be.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tycho's observations of comet and supernova already challenged this idea.
        \item Galileo used telescope to spot imperfections (sunspots, and craters on the moon)
    \end{itemize}
    \item If Earth were really orbiting Sun, we'd detect stellar parallax.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Galileo showed stars must be much farther than Tycho thought — in part by using his telescope to see the Milky Way is countless individual stars. If stars were much farther away, then lack of detectable parallax was no longer so troubling.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
He also saw Jupiter's moons so not everything was orbiting earth. Proved Venus' orbit of the sun and used it to explain retrograde motion.

\subsubsection{Scientific Theory}
Science Hallarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modern science seeks explanations for observed phenomena that rely solely on natural causes.(A scientific model cannot include divine intervention)
    \item Science progresses through the creation and  testing of models of nature that explain the  observations as simply as possible. (Simplicity = "Occam's razor")
    \item A scientific model must make testable predictions about natural phenomena that would force us to revise or abandon the model if the predictions do not agree with observations
\end{itemize}

A scientific theory must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain a wide variety of observations with a few simple principles
    \item Must be supported by a large, compelling body of evidence
    \item Must NOT have failed any crucial test of its validity
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Astrology}
 Astronomy is a science focused on learning about how stars, planets, and other celestial  objects work. Astrology is a search for hidden influences on  human lives based on the positions of planets  and stars in the sky.

\subsection{Making Sense of the Universe: Understanding Motion, Energy, and Gravity}
Momentum = mass X velocity.

Angular momentum = mass x velocity x radius

Remember that force is based on acceleration not speed.

Remember that weight force and mass is matter

Newtons Laws:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An object moves at constant velocity unless a net force acts to change its speed or direction.
    \item Force = mass x acceleration
    \item For every force, there is always an equal andopposite reaction force
\end{itemize}

Conservation Laws:
\begin{itemize}
    \item conservation if momentum
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The total momentum of interacting objects cannot change unless an external force is acting on them.
        \item Interacting objects exchange momentum through equal and opposite forces.
    \end{itemize}
    \item conservation of angular momentum
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The angular momentum of an object cannot change unless an external twisting force (torque) is acting on it.
        \item Earth experiences no twisting force as it orbits the Sun, so its rotation and orbit will continue indefinitely.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Types of energy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kinetic (motion)
    \item Radiative (light)
    \item Potential (stored)
    \item Thermal: The collective kinetic energy of many particles
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the many particles in a substance
    \end{itemize}
    \item Gravitational Potential
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In space, an object or gas cloud has more gravitational energy when it is spread out than when it contracts.– A contracting cloud converts gravitational potential energy to thermal energy
        \item $F_g = G\frac{M_1 M_2}{d^2}$
        \item items orbit around their center of mass (usually close to the big thing they are orbiting)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mass: $E = mc^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A small amount of mass can release a great deal of energy (for example, an H-bomb).
        \item Concentrated energy can spontaneously turn into particles (for example, in particle accelerators).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We combine Newton's law of gravity and Keplers orbital law:\\
\begin{center}
    $p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_1 + M_2)}a^3$\\
    p = orbital period\\
    a = average orbital distance\\
    M = object masses
\end{center}

The total orbital energy is the sum of gravitational and kinetic and remains the same (which is why we go faster closer). This means its very hard to change an orbit.

Earth's escape velocity is 11km/s (40000km/h)

Tides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item caused by moon being closer to one side
    \item depends on phase because of sun's position
    \item tidal friction slows earths rotation, making moon get farther from Earth
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Light and Matter: Reading Messages from the Cosmos}
How do light and matter interact?
\begin{itemize}
    \item emission/absorption (determines brightness)
    \item transmission
    \item reflection (determines color)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Waves}
Speed of light = wavelength x frequency\\
Photon energy = (6.626*10$10^-34$) plancks constant * frequency

Polarization is the direction a light wave is vibrating

\subsubsection{Matter}
Vocabulary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Atomic number = \# of protons in nucleus
    \item Atomic mass number = \# of protons + neutrons
    \item Isotope: same \# of protons but different \# of neutrons
    \item Ionization: stripping of electrons, changing atoms into plasma
    \item Dissociation: breaking of molecules into atoms
    \item Evaporation: breaking of flexible chemical bonds, changing liquid into solid
    \item Melting: breaking of rigid chemical bonds, changing solid into liquid
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Light}
Three types of spectra: emission line (specific elements emit light at certain wavelengths due to electrons jumping), continuous, absorption line (a cloud in between absorbes some light).

\subsubsection{Thermal Radiation}
 Hotter objects emit more light at all frequencies per unit area. Hotter objects emit photons with a higher average energy.

Wein's law approximates starts to blackbody radiators (absorbs all kinds of radiation and emits energy regardless). Peak wavelength times the temperature is a constant (Plank radiation constant): $\lambda_{peak}T = 2.898\times10^3$. This also means that stars of shorter wavelength (blue) are hotter.

Interpretting Spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
    \item look for parts of the visible spectrum that have lower intensity (low intensity blue light means it looks red and vice versa)
    \item look for a spike in the infrared to indicate tempurature
    \item look for absorbtion lines for the content of the atmosphere
    \item look for emission lines to describe the upper atmosphere
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Doppler effect}
As something moves towards us its spectrum gets shifted
\begin{enumerate}
    \item measure spectrum of stars composition in lab (heat gases)
    \item measure spectrum of star
    \item compare placement of lines
    \item if wavelength of star is longer than lab (it shifted right/red) its moving away
    \item $f_{star} = \sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \times f_{lab}$
\end{enumerate}

When an object is rotating the width of its spectral lines can tell us how fast its spinning.

\subsection{Telescopes Portals of Discovery}
Two most important properties of telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Light-collecting area: Telescopes with a larger collecting area can gather a greater amount of light in a shorter time.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A = \pi r^2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Angular resolution: Telescopes that are larger are capable of taking images with greater detail.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item minimum angular separation the telescope can distinguish, diffraction limit is caused by interference of light waves in telescope (larger = less interference)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Two basic designs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item refracting: focus light with lenses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item need to be long and large with heavy lenses
    \end{itemize}
    \item reflecting: focus light with mirrors
    \begin{itemize}
        \item larger diameters
        \item most common
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Uses of telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item imaging: pictures
    \begin{itemize}
        \item record only one color at a time
        \item use color to represent invisible light
    \end{itemize}
    \item spectroscopy: breaking up light spectra
    \item time monitoring: watching how light output of object varies with time
\end{itemize}

Problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item twinkling: turbulence in earths atmosphere distorts veiw and causes stars to twinkle (can be fixed by rapidly changing the shape of the mirror)
    \item light pollution
    \item certain wavelengths cannot pierce atmosphere
    \begin{itemize}
        \item gamma rays - 10km, balloons
        \item x rays - 100km, rockets
        \item ultraviolet - some reach earth but some require rockets
        \item visible - reaches ground
        \item infrared - 5km, some mountains, planes
        \item radio - reaches ground
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item radio: giant mirror that reflects radio waves to focus point
    \item infrared and ultraviolet: like visible telescopes but need to be above the atmosphere
    \item x-ray: also need to be above atmosphere, mirrors arranged to focus x-ray photons through grazing bounces off of mirrors
    \item gamma-ray: also need to be above atmosphere, fucking hard to focus gamma rays
\end{itemize}

Multiple telescopes (Inferometry) increase the angular resolution of a single large image

\subsection{Our Planetary System}

\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=0.5]{planetData}

\subsubsection{Spacecraft Exploration}
\textbf{Flyby}: flys past a planet (usually a slingshot type path), cheapest but gathers less data

\textbf{Orbiters}: go into orbit around object, more time to gather data

\textbf{Probes and Landers}: land on surface, most expensive

\textbf{Combination}: an orbiter drops a lander and continues its orbit

\subsection{Other Planetary Systems: The New Science of Distant Worlds}
Its hard to learn about extrasolar planets because planets are too close to their star and too dark to easily see.


Planet Detection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct: pictures or spectra of the planets themselves
    \item Indirect: measurements of stellar properties revealing the effects of orbiting planets
\end{itemize}


Stars wobble back and forth a bit because they are also pulled by their planets' gravity which we can use to reveal the mass (this is a lower limit since we would need to know its tilt to be accurate) and orbit of planets. These changes are very hard to see and we need to use doppler technique to measure them (accurate to 1m/s of movement).

The first extrasolar planet was discovered around 51 Pegasi when a 4 day orbital cycle was found. This means that the planet is very close to the star (it also has a mass similar to jupiter)

If you see a star with a wobble of greater than 1 year it has a planet closer than 1AU.

We can also watch for changes in brightness when a planet passes infront of the star called a transit. We use this to tell the planet's radius. The Kepler mission was launched to look for these tiny changes in brightness.

We can also use gravitational lensing to see how a planet's mass bends the light of a star and dust disks to see gaps in disks of dust and gas around stars where planets are.

We can also monitor the change in spectrum during a planet's transit across its star to know about its atmosphere composition. Similarly we can measure the surface tempertaure of the planet by seeing how the temperature of the star changes as the planet passes it.

Most detected planets have orbits smaller than Jupiter's but this is because planets at a farther distance are harder to detect. Some extrasolar planets have more eliptical orbits and tend to have greater mass than Jupiter (this is also because smaller mass planets are harder to detect).

Extrasolar planet suprprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item highly elliptical orbits
    \item huge diversity of size and density
    \item massive planets very close to their start (hot Jupiters)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nebular theory predicts that massive planets cannot form inside of frost line ($<<$ 5AU)
        \item may be explained by planetary migration or gravitational encounters
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{planetary migration}: young planets spin very quickly and can form disks which can tug the planet's orbit inward
            \item \textbf{gravitational encounters}: two massive planets getting two close to each other can result in one getting ejected into a highly elliptical orbit, multiple ones can cause a inward migration, this is due to one planet transfering energy and angular momentum to the other
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The above weirdness caused a reevaluation of Nebular Theory

\subsection{Life in the Universe}
Life on earth started ~3.85 billion years ago shortly after a heavy bombardment as fossils and carbon dating imply. Fossiles tend to be found in sedimentary rock.

\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=0.7]{geologicalTimeline}

We all know that life came about through evolution. Genetics builds a tree of life through relationships that implies a common ancestor for all life probably similar to bacteria found deep in the ocean near volcanic vents. We still dont know how that common ancestor came to be. The Miller-Urey experiment (among others) shows that the building blocks of life can arise spontaneously under the conditions of early earth.

Chemicals to Life:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Naturally forming organic molecules are building blocks of life
    \item Clay minerals catalyze production of RNA and membranes that form pre-cells
    \item Molecular natrual selection favors efficient self-replicating RNA molecules
    \item True living cells with RNA genome give rise to RNA world
    \item DNA evolves from RNA and biological evolution continues
\end{enumerate}

One idea is that live could have come from another planet (Venus, Earth, and Mars exchanged tones of rock and some microbes can survive for years in space).

Brief History of life:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4.4 billion years - early oceans form
    \item 3.5 billion years - cyanobacteria start releasing oxygen
    \item 2.0 billion years - oxygen begins building up in atmosphere
    \item 540–500 million years - Cambrian Explosion
    \item 225–65 million years - dinosaurs and small mammals (dinosaurs ruled)
    \item Few million years - earliest hominids
\end{itemize}

Oxygen didn't always exist so readily on earth. The evolution of \textbf{cyanobacteria} kicked it off by releasing oxygen to the atmosphere using photosynthesis.

(Bear)Necessity of Life:
\begin{itemize}
    \item nutrient source
    \item energy
    \item liquid water
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Life on Other Planets}
Erosion lines on mars imply that it had liquid water in its distant past, there is still subsurface ice would could result in near surface water near its volcanoes. The Curiosity rover landed on mars to investigate the habitability of the planet.

Another potential is the moon \textbf{Europa} which we think has a layer of liquid water or warm convecting ice. Two other Jupiter moons, \textbf{Ganymede} and \textbf{Callisto} also show evidence of subsurface oceans. Very little energy reaches these moons, but life may be possible.

The moon \textbf{Titan} is much too cold for liquid water (there may be some deep under the surface) but it does have lakes of liquid methane.

\textbf{Encelandus} has ice foundations that suggest it may have a subsurface ocean.

\subsubsection{Life Outside our Solar System}
Habitable Solar System:
\begin{itemize}
    \item old enough to allow time for evolution (no high mass stars, too young, 1\% of systems)
    \item need to have stable orbits (might rule out multistar systems, 50\% of systems)
    \item must have habitable zone (place where planets of the right size could have liquid water), larger stars have larger zones
\end{itemize}
There are billions of stars in the milky way alone that fulfill the above constraints.

It is very hard to spot a earth like planet due to their size and distance from their star (see previous section on finding extrasolar planets for a better explanation). We launched Kepler specifically to look at 100,000 stars for habitable planets and future inferometers may be precise enough to see earth-sized planets.

We can also use spectrometry to see the composition of planets to determine if they have the elements necessary for life.

\subsubsection{Earth-like Planets}
Some scientists argue that the proportions of heavy elements need to be just right for the formation of habitable planets. If so, then Earth-like planets are restricted to a galactic habitable zone.

Some scientists argue that the proportions of heavy elements need to be just right for the formation of habitable planets. If so, then Earth-like planets are restricted to a galactic habitable zone.

Some scientists argue that plate tectonics and/or a large moon are necessary to keep the climate of an Earth-like planet stable enough for life.

We dont know how important the above concerns are so its very hard to make a guess as to how common earth-like planets are and how many would be habitable.

\subsubsection{The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence}
The drake equation tries to calculate how many civilization we could communicate with exist
\begin{center}
    $N_{HP} \times f_{life} \times f_{civ} \times f_{now}$
\end{center}
$N_{HP}$ = total number of habitable planets in galaxy = probably billions\\
$f_{life}$ = fraction of habitable planets with life = hard to say (near 0 or 1)\\
$f_{civ}$ = fraction of life-bearing planets with civilization at some time = took 4 billion years on earth \\
$f_{now}$ = fraction of civilizations around now = depends on if civilizations survive long-term

Humans are not very exceptional (not too far from a line of best fit) in our brain mass to body mass ratio.

SETI is designed to look for deliberate signals from extraterrestrial civilizations and even to send some messages of our own.

\subsubsection{Interstellar Travel and Communications}
Current spacecrafts travel at one ten thousandth of the speed of light which means it would take a ridiculous amount of time to get to the nearest stars. We sent a message out with Voyager in hopes of reaching one someday.

Problems with space travel:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Far more efficient engines are needed.
    \item Energy requirements are enormous.
    \item Ordinary interstellar particles become like cosmic rays.
    \item Social complications of time dilation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fermi's paradox} suggests that civilizations should be very common in our galaxy so why haven't we found any.

Explanations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  life/civilization is much rarer than we might have guessed
    \item Civilizations are common, but interstellar travel is not
    \begin{itemize}
        \item interstellar travel is more difficult than we think.
        \item the desire to explore is rare.
        \item civilizations destroy themselves before achieving interstellar travel.
    \end{itemize}
    \item we just haven't met them yet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Space and Time}
Einstein's Theories of Relativity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Special Relativity: usual ideas of space and time change as we approach the speed of light ($E = mc^2$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no object can travel faster than light
        \item observing a object near the speed of light:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item time slows down
            \item length contracts in direction of motion
            \item mass increases
        \end{itemize}
        \item simultaneousness changes based on your frame of reference
    \end{itemize}
    \item General Relativity: new views of gravity
\end{itemize}

Motion is relative. Usually how fast your percieve something is based on your velocity compared to it. The exception is light which always is seen at the same speed (called \textbf{absolute relativity})

Postulates of special relativity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item laws of nature are the same for everyone
    \item speed of light is the same for everyone
\end{itemize}

Time Dilation:
\begin{center}
    $t_1 = t_0\sqrt{1-\bigg(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)}$
\end{center}
Length Contraction:
\begin{center}
    $l_1 = l_0\sqrt{1-\bigg(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)}$
\end{center}
Mass Increase:
\begin{center}
    $m_1 = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\bigg(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)}}$
\end{center}
Since no information can be transfered faster than the speed of light objects traveling near the speed of light will perceived information at different rates since the information is moving much more slowly relative to their speed.

\subsubsection{Tests for Relativity}
Michelson-Morley experiment found evidence for the absoluteness of the speed of light in 18887.

Time dilation occurs often to subatomic particles in accelerators.

Time dilation discovered with airplanes and very precise clocks.

$E = mc^2$ verified by measurements taken of the sun.

If the speed of light were not absolute light coming from a car moving towards you would travel at 100km/hr + c and a car moving parallel to you would be see at 100 km/hr so witnessing their collision would look very odd.
