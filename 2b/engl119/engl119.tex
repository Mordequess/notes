\section{Communication}
This class will primarily focus on
\begin{itemize}
\item selecting the right information
\item choosing the right words
\item organizing and presenting this information
\end{itemize}

When communicating, it is important to take into account the {\bf audience}, {\bf purpose}, and {\bf context}. The audience and purpose are mostly self-explanatory, and the context deals with everything else: the surrounding circumstances, situation, medium of communication, et cetera.

Failures in communication are often the result of having poor coherence, disregarding conventions, or being insensitive to professional expectations.
