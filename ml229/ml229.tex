\section*{What is Machine Learning?}
Machine learning is a field which grew out of the AI dream: the goal of one day having computers think for themselves. It touches a wide variety of industries -- spam filters, predictive searching, facial identification, data mining, natural language processing... -- and is based on the application of learning algorithms taking input data, and determining the proper response. The most accurate definition of a machine learning problem is to say that a machine learning in problem is any one where for some task $T$ performed with experience $E$ and measured by metric $M$, $M$ improves as $E$.

There are two main categories of machine learning algorithms: {\bf supervised learning} and {\bf unsupervised learning}. There also exist less widely-used algorithms such as {\bf reinforcement learning} and {\bf recommender systems}.
